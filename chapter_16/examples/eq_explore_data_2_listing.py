Here, weâ€™ll make a list that contains all the information about every
earthquake that occurred.
We take the data associated with the key 'features' and store it in
all_eq_dicts.
Notice how short this code is. The neatly formatted file
readable_eq_data.json has over 6,000 lines. But in just a few lines,
we can read through all that data and store it in a Python list.
